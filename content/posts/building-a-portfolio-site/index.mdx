This Halloween Weekend, I decided to take on the challenge of building myself a portfolio website. As someone currently looking for a job as a Full-Stack Developer, being able to show potential employers, clients, and my friends a website that showcases my work is a huge plus. I've learned so much about MERN development since starting at Milestone Computer Solutions a year ago, and with every new skill I learn, I'm excited to see what I can do with it.

### The Challenges
As I've been building this site, I've learned that creating a portfolio site can come with many technical and conceptual challenges. In this post, I'll be going over the challenges I faced, and how I solved them.

##### Choosing Technologies

When I was building my portfolio site, I went through at least three or four iterations of sites using React, working on the starter code during the weekend, adding my social links and some content, and then completely scrapped it. I was able to get a working site that looked nice, but I would learn a new skill that convinced me to start over and build it even better.

Building websites professionally, you're working with deadlines and deliverables that are set by the client. You're also working with other people who have requirements and expectations to meet for the project. Building a site for yourself doesn't have many of those hard requirements, and that can be both a blessing and a curse. The possibilities are endless.

I spend my work day working with React and Node, so I knew I wanted to show off the skills I've gained using some of those technologies. I also wanted to use a CMS (Content Management System), which is a way to more easily manage adding and updating content for a website. I chose Gatsby, which is a static site generator that I'm relatively new to. Static site generators are great for sites that you want to be scalable, fast, and easy to maintain.

I chose Gatsby because it uses React, and that's the technology I'm most familiar with. If you're more familiar with a language like Go you can use Hugo. If you like programming with Ruby, then you could use Jekyll. If you're more familiar with PHP, then you could use Wordpress. I've built several sites at work using WordPress, and it's great for beginners to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a large list of all of the widely-used static site generators over at [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There are so many options when it comes to static site generators, and I've found using a CMS to be a much better option than trying to build a site from a completely empty project.

##### Curating your Work

The next biggest challenge was with choosing which examples of my previous work to show off. At my job, almost all of my work is done under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This means that I can't show off my work to anyone outside of my company and their clients. This also means that a lot of my work can't be shown to other employers, and what is visible on my GitHub for the most part is just a few examples of small, personal projects and much older work from when I was in college.

When I'm working on these projects for clients, or stress-testing technologies to see if I can use them for professional projects, I often use a tools that allow me to quickly run small snippits of code. Of these tools, my favorites are [CodePen](https://codepen.io), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). I've found that I can use these sites to quickly prototype an idea or look, then take that code and modify it to work in muliples projects. Because I build this code in a project-agnostic, modular way, I can easily reuse the code for other client projects and at the same time show it off on my website. So far, CodePen has been the best fit for prototyping any front-end code I'm working on. When I need to work on testing small parts of a large, back-end project, I like using Glitch. For any other language, like when I'm testing Python or PHP code when maintaining other company projects, I like using Repl.it as it supports multiple languages and is easy to use.

Also, because I'm using a CMS, it's much easier to add new work I've done to my site in the future. I can add new work to my site by simply uploading a new image, or adding a new blog post. You can view some snippits of my code on CodePen [here](/CWMitchell/pens/public).

##### Keeping it Simple

When building my site, one of the main motivators for me to start back from scratch was that I wanted to show off so many of my skills in one place. I wanted to show all the frameworks and technologies that I've learned, but it became difficult to navigate and maintain over time. 

For this site, I chose to go with a Gatsby Template called [Minimal Blog](https://minimal-blog.lekoarts.de/) by LekoArts. This template was the blank canvas that I'd been looking for. It's a simple, clean, and minimalistic template that can be customized to fit whatever look you'd like. If you don't like it, you can change it or choose from one of the many other templates that Gatsby offers. (I also really love the dark mode)

##### Final Thoughts
When building a site, keep your audience in mind.

The first few iterations of my site tried to show off so many different technologies that it became an eye-sore. Showing that you can build a clean, maintainable site (that's a little flashy) can be just as impressive as the kitchen-sink approach. It's also probably much more like the sites you will be building for clients in the future! If you pick the right technologies and gather your past work and examples in one place, you can build a beautiful, elegant portfolio site that's easy to maintain. For me, that was using Gatsby, React, and Node.
